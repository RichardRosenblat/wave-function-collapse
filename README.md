# Wave Function Collapse

This is a React project that implements the **Wave Function Collapse Algorithm** in a simple application to solve a Sudoku Puzzle.

## What is a Wave Function Collapse Algorithm?

The WFCA (Wave function Collapse Algorithm) is a way to generate random patterns that *"Make sense"* by following a given set of rules.  
**It is based in concepts from quantum mechanics!** and it looks very complex but in reality it's quite simple once you understand it's core concepts and the steps that it takes to generate the random pattern.  

The Algorithm works with these core concepts

1. A grid of cells with multiple states
2. A set of rules that these states must obey
3. A way to collapse a cell's state
